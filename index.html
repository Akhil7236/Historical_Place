                        completed in 1648 AD, with the mosque, the guest house and the main gateway on the south, the
                        outer courtyard and its cloisters were added subsequently and completed in 1653 AD. The
                        existence of several historical and Quaranic inscriptions in Arabic script have facilitated

                        monument, the Taj Mahal. The fort can be more accurately described as a walled city.After the
                        First Battle of Panipat in 1526, the victorious Babur stayed in the fort, in the palace of
                        Ibrahim Lodi. He later built a baoli in it. His successor, Humayun, was crowned in the fort in

                        immediately after the defeat of Delhi's last Hindu kingdom. The tower has five distinct storeys,

                        the top. The first three storeys are made of red sandstone; the fourth and fifth storeys are of
                        marble and sandstone. At the foot of the tower is the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, the first mosque
                        to be built in India. An inscription over its eastern gate provocatively informs that it was
                        built with material obtained from demolishing '27 Hindu temples'. A 7 m-high iron pillar stands
                        in the courtyard of the mosque. It is said that if you can encircle it with your hands while

                        red and white, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the
                        Taj Mahal. The fort represents the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan, and combines
                        Persianate palace architecture with Indian traditions.The fort was plundered of its artwork and
                        jewels during Nadir Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empi1739. Most of the fort's marble structures
                        were subsequently demolished by the British followinIndian Rebellion of 1857. The fort's
                        defensive walls were largely undamaged, and the fortressubsequently used as a garrison.<a
